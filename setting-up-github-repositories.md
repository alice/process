# Setting up github repositories for specifications

This document tries to describe how we set up github repositories
for specifications or specification-like documents.
These documents are generally maintained in either
[bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed/)
or
[respec](https://github.com/w3c/respec/).

Also see [W3C's FAQ on using GitHub](https://w3c.github.io/faq.html).

## Naming the repository

The repository should be named with the shortname of your document.

Every W3C document has a "shortname", which is a short, memorable name for the document. The document's shortname should be all lowercase, and words should be separated by hyphens.

## Structuring the repository

Structure your branch names without concern for any features offered by GitHub.  In particular, don't commit source to a `gh-pages` branch.  (In some cases automation may commit generated output to a `gh-pages` branch, though.)  Note that some of our existing repositories do not follow this advice and commit respec source to a `gh-pages` branch.

This branch should contain only the source; files generated by bikeshed (or respec) should not be committed.

## Configuring your Bikeshed document

Create a document named `index.bs` in your repository.

It should start with a `<pre class=metadata>` section like this:

```html
<pre class=metadata>
Title: The title of your document
URL: https://w3ctag.github.io/your-repository-name/
Shortname: your-shortname
Repository: w3ctag/your-repository-name
Group: tag
Editor: Your Name, w3cid NNNNN, Company name https://company.com, your@email.address
Default Biblio Status: current
Markup Shorthands: markdown yes
Abstract: A description of your document.
</pre>
```

Your w3cid is the number at the end of the url when you navigate to [https://www.w3.org/users/myprofile](https://www.w3.org/users/myprofile).

If the document has previously been published (as a Finding or a Working Group Note), add metadata pointing at the most recently published version:

```html
TR: url-to-the-latest-published-version
```

### Additional metadata for Findings

When we're working on a document that we intend to end up as a TAG Finding, the in-progress document is a Draft Finding.

```html
Status: DRAFT-FINDING
```

### Additional metadata for Notes

When we're working on a document that we intend to end up as a Working Group Note, the in-progress document is an Editor's Draft (ED). Bikeshed requires Editor's Drafts to have a level specified, but we don't use levels for TAG documents.

```html
Status: ED
Level: none
```

## Configuring github settings

After creating the repository, change the following aspects of its settings:
1. In the **Options** tab, under **Merge button**, uncheck **Allow merge commits**
2. In the **Options** tab, under **GitHub Pages**, set the **Source**:
   * for bikeshed specs, set it to **gh-pages**
   * for respec specs, set it to **master** or whatever the primary branch is (note that some older specs use `gh-pages`, but this is no longer needed)
3. In the **Branches** tab, under **Branch protection rules**, choose **Add rule**.  Create a rule matching `master` (or whatever the primary branch is), and check the two checkboxes **Require linear history** and **Include administrators**.  (Also *consider* whether to check **Require pull request reviews before merging** or **Require status checks to pass before merging**.)

## Configuring automatic running of bikeshed

For bikeshed specs, we set up autogeneration of the bikeshed output from the source.
The source is (as described above) on the `master` branch (or whatever other name we use for the primary branch),
and we set up automatic running of `bikeshed` to generate its output and commit it to the `gh-pages` branch.

This is done by roughly following the steps in
[Domenic's gist](https://gist.github.com/domenic/ec8b0fc8ab45f39403dd),
(though it's worth looking at the version history of that gist since the older versions had more detail in some ways).
It may be useful to copy the 
[`deploy-gh-pages.sh` in `design-principles`](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-principles/blob/master/deploy-gh-pages.sh).

**TODO**: Expand on this the next time one of us does it.

## Configuring PR Preview

We have **already** set up [PR Preview](https://github.com/tobie/pr-preview) by using the steps:
1. go to [PR Preview GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/pr-preview)
2. click **Configure** on the right
3. Choose the @w3ctag organization
4. choose to set it up for **All repositories**

This means that all we need to enable PR Preview is to add a `.pr-preview.json`, which is easiest to do by using the [PR Preview setup helper](https://tobie.github.io/pr-preview/config.html) and choosing the appropriate defaults there.
